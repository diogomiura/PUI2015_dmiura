PLOT 3: jjh562  jjhall77


![Alt text](plot3.png)

CLARITY: I find the y-axis labels quite confusing given the unit is millions, but the actual numbers are expressed in 10 to the power of negative numbers. I also suspect that the units are actually wrong, as I’m unaware of counties that generate nearly 1 mn ton of per capita carbon emissions in a single year. 

ESTHETIC: I find the esthetics of this plot particularly functional for what it is trying to communicate – the color scheme makes it particularly easier to visualize the 3 different groups depicted in it. 

HONESTY: The plot seems to overall fairly represent the data. However, the y and x axis limits seem considerably wider than necessary, particularly if we make adjustments for outliers, which makes the data seem more grouped than it would seem otherwise.

SUGGESTIONS: Check y-axis units and narrow y and x axis limits.
