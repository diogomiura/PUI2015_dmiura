I have worked on assignments 1 and 2 alone. 
I have described each step in the exercises as comments in my ipynb files. 
I could not use the professor's template for exercise 2 as it did not open in my machine, so I created a new file to solve the problems.
In assignment 3, I worked with Dara, Neil, Nate and Keith. We met @ Metrotech to work together on it. I helped with some lines of the pandas code and also helped with the statistical concepts regarding the Chi-square test.
