PLOT 1: yx1088  yanchao1992

![Alt text](plot1.png)

CLARITY: The plot is easy to read, although I would highlight the following confusing points: 
(1)	The plot is titled “The Age of Male Citibike Riders and Their Ridership”. “Ridership” is a vague term in this context, so the title does not clearly communicate the content of the plot; 
(2)	The time period being represented is unclear in the plot;
(3)	The y-axis does not specify the unit of the trip duration.

ESTHETICS: The sizes of the plot title and axis labels are clearly disproportionate to the plot itself.  

HONESTY: While I would not say the plot misrepresents the dataset, it does not achieve its purpose of representing trip duration for male Citibike riders. This is mostly due to outliers: 
(1)	Very few rides seem to surpass 2,000 seconds, but the y-axis goes up to 2,500,000 seconds, which does not seem appropriate in this case; 
(2)	The x-axis goes up to 140 years, and there are several rides above 100. It seems reasonable to suspect these riders did not correctly input their ages in their subscriptions and classify these points as outliers.

SUGGESTIONS: Change title to clearly convey your message; include unit in y-axis; increase font sizes; and exclude outliers.
