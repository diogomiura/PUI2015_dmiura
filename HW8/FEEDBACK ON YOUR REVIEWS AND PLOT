your reviews were excellent 10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================


small tick labels

small axis label (not terribly small but a bit)

the faint colors may not render well in a page with other stuff in it. 

assigning shades of red and blue to females and males does enhance clarity through intuition but it charges the plot with gender issues: more neutral colors are advisable. 

the distribution of the data would probably be suitable to a log scale on the y axis. this would separate the bottom of the range, which now appears to be the same by eye for all categories.



NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================

============


tick and axis labels are too small

the colors indicate the structure in the data nicely but the three shades are not distinguishable by people affected by the most common color blind variety

in general the default 3 datapoints in the legend should be substitute with a single point, as they are redundant, but in this case since the datapoints are small to allow to see the overlapping structure (presumably) the three datapoints are justified. 

10^0 should be replaced with 1, 10^1 with 10



neilverosh
============

colors are nicely vivid and color blind compliant

axis labels too small

the plot is largely empty (remember tufte's rules!) a shorter more compact y axis would help comparison

============
  
Colors are indistinguishable for color blind people

tick labels are too small


it would be nice if it said "basketball" somewhere, and had the date of the data

the points are too small resulting in a lot of empty space (remember tufte's rules) and the points at 0 are chopped by the axis: an offset should be provided

otherwise clear and not misleading
