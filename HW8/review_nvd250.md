PLOT 2: nvd250  neilverosh

![Alt text](plot2.png)

CLARITY: The y-axis is not fully clear for me. The label says it is measuring the stock index, but the plot is actually comparing an actual stock index (NASDAQ) with a single stock (Apple), so I donâ€™t understand the actual unit of each of these series.   

ESTHETIC: There seems to be an issue with the limit of the y-axis, given both series seem to surpass the 1.0 upper value towards the end of the series. Given the series ends in 2015, the audience of the plot might be interested in the specific end date of the series, but that is not clear in the x-axis.

HONESTY: The purpose of the plot seems to be the comparison of the performance of Apple shares vs. the NASDAQ index. However, the lines seem to be indicating absolute values for each series, which disables a clear identification of when the stock actually outperformed the index.

SUGGESTIONS: Based on my previous comment, my main suggestion would be to rebase both series (as 100, for instance) at the start date of the plot. I would also clarify the unit of each series, expand the y-axis limit and include the date of the upper x-axis limit.
